If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is.Fix one bug, introduce two more.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Documentation is a love letter to your future self.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is thinking, not typing.Segmentation fault (core dumped).One does not simply write good commit messages.Your code is only as good as your last commit.If your code works the first time, check again.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Fix one bug, introduce two more.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Code never lies, comments sometimes do.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"Automate everything.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.My code works… I have no idea why.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Programming is 90% frustration, 10% eureka moments.No code is better than bad code.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.With great power comes great responsibility… to write unit tests.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.Messy code today means late nights tomorrow.Code like you care.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.keystyon
