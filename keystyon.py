If software was easy, everyone would do it.One does not simply write good commit messages.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.Hello, world!Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.The cloud is just someone else’s downtime.Deploy first, ask questions later.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.When in doubt, refactor.With great power comes great responsibility… to write unit tests.Trust the process, but verify the output.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Don’t reinvent the wheel unless it’s broken.Keep calm and write Python.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.Pushing to production on a Friday should be illegal.Code like you care.Keyboard not responding. Press F1 to continue.If your code works the first time, check again.A good developer never stops learning.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.Push small changes frequently.The real challenge in programming is working with other developers.Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable from a feature.Real devs use dark mode.Code like there is no tomorrow.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Try, catch, cry.The only thing worse than a bug is an intermittent bug.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.Your code is only as good as your last commit.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Code reviews: where your ego goes to die.Code like you mean it.When in doubt, print it out.Whitespace matters.Roses are red, violets are blue, I lost a whole weekend debugging this issue.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.One does not simply write good commit messages.Hello, world!Just because it compiles doesn’t mean it works.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Sometimes, code is poetry. Sometimes, it’s horror.Git blame is my favorite detective tool.The best way to learn is to break something.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"Code never lies, comments sometimes do."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"Programming is an endless cycle of solving problems you created for yourself.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.If (code == ugly) { refactor(); }Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.The best code is no code at all.Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.Don’t push on Fridays.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is.Fix one bug, introduce two more.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Documentation is a love letter to your future self.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is thinking, not typing.Segmentation fault (core dumped).One does not simply write good commit messages.Your code is only as good as your last commit.If your code works the first time, check again.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Fix one bug, introduce two more.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Code never lies, comments sometimes do.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"Automate everything.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.My code works… I have no idea why.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Programming is 90% frustration, 10% eureka moments.No code is better than bad code.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.With great power comes great responsibility… to write unit tests.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.Messy code today means late nights tomorrow.Code like you care.Why do Java developers wear glasses?
