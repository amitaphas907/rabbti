Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Code never lies, comments sometimes do.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"Automate everything.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.My code works… I have no idea why.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Programming is 90% frustration, 10% eureka moments.No code is better than bad code.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.With great power comes great responsibility… to write unit tests.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.Good software is like a good joke—it needs no explanation.Messy code today means late nights tomorrow.Code like you care.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.keystyon
